A machine learning project to predict real estate prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, etc.
==>> Introduction
The Real Estate Price Predictor project aims to predict the prices of real estate properties based on various input features using machine learning algorithms. This project can help potential buyers, sellers, and real estate agents to estimate property prices accurately.

==>> Features
Predict real estate prices based on multiple features
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Model training and evaluation
Interactive web interface for predictions
==>> Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook
Flask (for web interface)
HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for web interface)
Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes information about real estate properties such as location, size, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, year built, and more. The dataset can be obtained from various real estate websites or public datasets.

==>> Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

Python 3.6+
pip (Python package installer)

==>> Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using various regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. The performance of different algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting is compared to select the best model.

==>> Results
The final model achieves an MAE of X, an MSE of Y, and an R-squared value of Z on the test dataset, indicating good predictive performance.
